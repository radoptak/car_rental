Rados≈Çaw Ptak - technical task for Tivix

NOTE:
In the framework I tried to showcase different approaches to gherkin scenarios, assertions, element picking and handling.
In proper framework for a legit application under test I would choose one approach and stick to it.
General rule of thumb in this project was to achive expected results in the simplest way possible, but since I wanted to showcase different approaches, hence the seemingly random inconsistences.

Additionaly I didn't remove examples folder and files to have a quick access to cypress guide.

Given more time, those would be next steps in framework development:
TODO:

- visual testing (snapshots)
- mochawsome reports (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mochawesome-report-generator)
- cross browser paralel testing
- headless mode

For now launching cypress tests with: npx cypress open
